 Project Overview & Motivation
MyApplication.4 is an advanced Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Sentinel System built as an Android app using Kotlin. Its main focus is real-time vehicular safety, targeting accident prevention and enhanced connectivity among nearby vehicles through cooperative navigation, collision and crash detection, and SOS broadcasting.

Motivation:
Modern road safety demands intelligent, real-time solutions that process sensor data, predict threats, and communicate instantly between vehicles—without relying on centralized infrastructure. Our project empowers every vehicle with smart, peer-to-peer communication and safety alerts to prevent crashes and respond faster in emergencies.

Setup & Requirements
Android Studio (latest version recommended)

Android SDK: API 33 or newer (Android 13+ required for some Wi-Fi Direct features)

Device: Real device w/ GNSS (GPS), Wi-Fi, sensors, and SMS capabilities (emulator may lack key hardware)

Dependencies: Handled via Gradle (see build.gradle.kts)

Why This Project Was Made
Road safety and accident prevention are critical in today’s world, but existing systems often depend on costly infrastructure or internet connectivity. MyApplication.4 solves this by using direct device-to-device communication (Wi-Fi Direct) and onboard sensors, ensuring fast alerts, decentralized operation, and enhanced privacy for all users.
